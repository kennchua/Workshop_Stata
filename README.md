This repository contains materials used during a five-day Stata workshop, which I designed and taught in the summer of 2017. 

The files include a set of lectures, exercises, and answer keys. Some of the lectures and exercises are currently being updated. Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to view or access the full set of materials for this course.
